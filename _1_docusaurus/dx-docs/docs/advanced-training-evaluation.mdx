**Exercise Brief - Build a personal finance tracker.**

You should be able to create monthly budgets, and each can have multiple budget items. Each of these budget items may be a parent of further budget items (e.g. Utilities -> Water + Electricity + Internet). Budget items should have at least a name and amount. For each budget item, you can add expenses. Expenses should have at least a name, amount, description and date captured. The expenses can have multiple receipts attached to them. Each receipt should have either, data of issue, amount or document.

As a user you should be able to quickly log an expense, and either immediately or later be able to link it to a budget item. You should be able to see unallocated expenses (not linked to a budget item) separated from the financial tracker. You should also have a dashboard summarizing your expenses progress over a month, both as a monthly single percentage and separately by budget items (categories).

You should try split this into 3 distinct areas: An admin page to configure budget items, a new expense page to quickly add expenses (and possibly update them further) and the dashboard to summarize any metrics you would deem fitting for a budget.
