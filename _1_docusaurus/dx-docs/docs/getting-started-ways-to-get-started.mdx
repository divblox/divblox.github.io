To start creating an app with Divblox, you need to configure a development environment (also known as a deployment environment). To do this you have a number of options:

1. The first and easiest way is to spin up a **Divblox sandbox** where you can get a feel for the Divblox environment and play around with most of Divblox's features

2. A slightly more advanced option that allows for more complex features, is to download the **Divblox VirtualBox image** and import that as a virtual machine on a local machine of your choosing
3. The third, and most hands on option, is to configure a **Divblox deployment environment from scratch** on a machine of your choosing

### Sandbox vs local deployment

> In a local deployment environment, more advanced features are available:

-   You can configure your server variables and modules
-   You can configure your database connections
-   You can export to native
-   You have full access to your entire code base
-   You can deploy your app to another deployment environment

> A deployment environment is defined as an instance of a project, that is hosted on a web server, which is accessible by a user.
> These can include, but are not limited to:

-   A local web server on a development computer
-   A cloud based web server
